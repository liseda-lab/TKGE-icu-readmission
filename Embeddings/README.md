## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
_This folder has the code and dependencies to run embedding models on our mimic-iii ICU readmission data set_

For this work we used several resources from other authors.

| Repo | Embeddings | URL  
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| TKBC | T-complEx, TNT-complEx | [TKBC](https://github.com/facebookresearch/tkbc.git) |
| OpenKE | TransE, complEx, distMult | [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE.git) |
| INK-USC | T-TransE, TA-TransE, TA-distMult | [INK-USC](https://github.com/INK-USC/RE-Net.git) |


_For details about the embedding methods please refer to the corresponding papers_

## **ðŸ“Š Usage**

1. Navigate to the resources folder and download or clone the three repositories needed for the embedding methods. These must be placed on the resources folder.
````python
    cd resources
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/tkbc.git
    git clone https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE.git
    git clone https://github.com/INK-USC/RE-Net.git
````

2. Navigate to the deploy folder and run the bacth files for each model. *The same script has the code for simple and semantic versions!
````python
    cd deploy
    sbatch deploy/ComplEx.sh
````

3. In case runing with batch is uncesserary, run the scripts in the files directly on the command line.

## **ðŸ“Œ Key Features**

_The embeddings generated will be used on the ML prediction framework. In case you desire just the embedding files, please reach out._
