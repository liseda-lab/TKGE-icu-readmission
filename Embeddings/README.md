## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
_This folder has the code and dependencies to run embedding models on our mimic-iii ICU readmission data set_

For this work we used several resources from other authors.

| Package | Embeddings | URL  
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| TKBC | T-complEx, TNT-complEx | [TKBC](https://github.com/facebookresearch/tkbc.git) |
| OpenKE | TransE, complEx, distMult | [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE.git) |
| INK-USC | T-TransE, TA-TransE, TA-distMult | [INK-USC](https://github.com/INK-USC/RE-Net.git) |
