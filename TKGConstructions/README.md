# **🎯Goal **
_This folder aims to generate the files needed for TKGS. Three types of files are gererated: Patient (P), Ontology (O), Merged. These files will be used to generate the traing set for the different files. Here is a summary of the pairing based on the different KGS._

| TKG Type | Files Requeired 
|-----------|-----------|
| _simple_ | Patient Files | 
| _semantic_ | Patient + Ontology Files (Merged)| 
| _temporal_ | Patient Files|
| _semantic-temporal_| Patient + Ontology Files (Merged)|

_These files will that be used to train the different embedding strategies._

## **❗️❕ Data availability ❗️❕**

To facilitate reproducibility, this step can be completlly skipped. The following downloads will provide a folder with just the files required for the next steps of our implementation. Please place this folder within the main folder of the project
